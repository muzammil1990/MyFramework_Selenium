something or some element id= 1234 got stale
some webelement which was present earlier is not present anymore after the page refresh.

In dom that element is still might be present but certain specific section of the webpage
which is a AJAX component got refreshed and is not present anymore.

So thats why we should not refresh page or else there is a high chance that our script might
fail.

scneario: Lets say usernmae field we have identified using
		 driver.findElement(By.name("username"));
		 
		 but if we intentionally refresh the page and do Debug a we may get staleElementReferenceException
		because that webelement id= 4562 might change.
